# ARC-Solvers
Library of baseline solvers for AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) Set (http://data.allenai.org/arc/).
These solvers retrieve relevant sentences from a large text corpus (ARC_Corpus.txt in the
dataset), and use two types of models to predict the correct answer.
 1. An entailment-based model that computes the entailment score for each `(retrieved sentence,
 question+answer choice as an assertion)` pair and scores each answer choice based on the
 highest-scoring sentence.
 2. A reading comprehension model (BiDAF) that converts the retrieved sentences into a paragraph
 per question. The model is used to predict the best answer span and each answer choice is scored
  based on the overlap with the predicted span.
 
 ## Setup environment
 1. Create the `arc_solvers` environment using Anaconda
 
```bash
conda create -n arc_solvers python=3.6
```
 
 2. Activate the environment
 
```bash
source activate arc_solvers
```
 
 3. Install the requirements in the environment: 
 
   ```
   bash scripts/install_requirements.sh
   ```
 
 4. Install pytorch as per instructions on <http://pytorch.org/>. Command as of Feb. 26, 2018:
 
```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```
  

 ## Setup data/models
 0. Run Elastic Search
  ```
  bin/elasticsearch -E http.port=9400 -E transport.tcp.port=9500 
  ```

 1. Download the data and models into `data/` folder. This will also build the ElasticSearch
 index (assumes ElasticSearch 6+ is running on `ES_HOST` machine defined in the script)
  ```
bash scripts/download_data.sh
  ```
 
 ## Running baseline models
 Run the entailment-based baseline solvers against a question set using `scripts/evaluate_solver.sh`

 2. Download and prepare embeddings. This will download glove.840B.300d.zip from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ and 
 convert it to glove.840B.300d.txt.gz which is readable from AllenNLP
```bash
sh download_and_prepare_glove.sh
```
 
## Running baseline models
Run the entailment-based baseline solvers against a question set using `scripts/evaluate_solver.sh`

### Running a pre-trained DGEM model
For example, to evaluate the DGEM model on the Challenge Set, run:
```bash
sh scripts/evaluate_solver.sh \
	data/ARC-V1-Feb2018/ARC-Challenge/ARC-Challenge-Test.jsonl \
	data/ARC-V1-Models-Aug2018/dgem/
```
Change `dgem` to `decompatt` to test the Decomposable Attention model.

### Running a pre-trained BiDAF model
To evaluate the BiDAF model, use the `evaluate_bidaf.sh` script
```bash
 sh scripts/evaluate_bidaf.sh \
    data/ARC-V1-Feb2018/ARC-Challenge/ARC-Challenge-Test.jsonl \
    data/ARC-V1-Models-Aug2018/bidaf/
```

### Training and evaluating the BiLSTM Max-out with Question to Choices Max Attention
This model implements an attention  interaction between the context-encoded
representations of the question and the choices. The model is described [here](arc_solvers/models/qa/README.md#bilstm-max-out-with-question-to-choices-max-attention).

To train the model, download the data and word embeddings
(see [Setup data/models](#setup-datamodels) above).

Evaluate the trained model:
```bash
python arc_solvers/run.py evaluate \
    --archive_file data/ARC-V1-Models-Aug2018/max_att/model.tar.gz \
    --evaluation_data_file data/ARC-V1-Feb2018/ARC-Challenge/ARC-Challenge-Test.jsonl
```

or

Train a new model:
```bash
python arc_solvers/run.py train \
    -s trained_models/qa_multi_question_to_choices/serialization/ \
    arc_solvers/training_config/qa/multi_choice/reader_qa_multi_choice_max_att_ARC_Chellenge_full.json
```


## Running against a new question set

 To run the baseline solvers against a new question set, create a file using the JSONL format.
 For example:
```json
{
    "id":"Mercury_SC_415702",
    "question": {
       "stem":"George wants to warm his hands quickly by rubbing them. Which skin surface will
               produce the most heat?",
       "choices":[
                  {"text":"dry palms","label":"A"},
                  {"text":"wet palms","label":"B"},
                  {"text":"palms covered with oil","label":"C"},
                  {"text":"palms covered with lotion","label":"D"}
                 ]
    },
    "answerKey":"A"
}
```
  Run the evaluation scripts on this new file using the same commands as above.


 ## Running a new Entailment-based model
  To run a new entailment model (implemented using AllenNLP), you need to
   1. Create a `Predictor` that converts the input JSON to an `Instance` expected by your
   entailment model. See [DecompAttPredictor](arc_solvers/service/predictors/decompatt_qa_predictor.py)
   for an example.

   2. Add your custom predictor to the [predictor overrides](arc_solvers/commands/__init__.py#L8)
   For example, if your new model is registered using `my_awesome_model` and the predictor is
   registered using `my_awesome_predictor`, add `"my_awesome_model": "my_awesome_predictor"` to
   the `predictor_overrides`.

   3. Run the `evaluate_solver.sh` script with your learned model in `my_awesome_model/model.tar.gz`:

```bash
 sh scripts/evaluate_solver.sh \
    data/ARC-V1-Feb2018/ARC-Challenge/ARC-Challenge-Test.jsonl \
    my_awesome_model/
```

## Running a new Reading Comprehension model
 To run a new reading comprehension (RC) model (implemented using AllenNLP), you need to
   1. Create a `Predictor` that converts the input JSON to an `Instance` expected by your
   RC model. See [BidafQaPredictor](arc_solvers/service/predictors/bidaf_qa_predictor.py)
   for an example.

   2. Add your custom predictor to the [predictor overrides](arc_solvers/commands/__init__.py#L8)
   For example, if your new model is registered using `my_awesome_model` and the predictor is
   registered using `my_awesome_predictor`, add `"my_awesome_model": "my_awesome_predictor"` to
   the `predictor_overrides`.

   3. Run the `evaluate_bidaf.sh` script with your learned model in `my_awesome_model/model.tar.gz`:

```bash
 sh scripts/evaluate_solver.sh \
    data/ARC-V1-Feb2018/ARC-Challenge/ARC-Challenge-Test.jsonl \
    my_awesome_model/
```
